# Store-sales-forecasting

In this project, I'm using time-series forecasting to forecast store sales on data from Corporaci√≥n Favorita, a large Ecuadorian-based grocery retailer.Specifically, building a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores. 

The training data includes dates, store and product information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the sales numbers. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models.
